	<p align="center">
	Welcome to a Software Engineering project by Danielle, Collin, and Matt. Our project is an implemenation of the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme using a web interface.<br>
	What is the Shamir Scheme you ask? Good question, thanks for asking. Shamir's scheme is an encryption algorithm which segments a piece of data,<br>
	in our case a string of text characters into coordinates on a polynomial function. The segments are encryped and can be distributed among individuals who then need to each enter their respective parts of the secret to reconstruct it.<br>
	With the Shamir scheme, many quantities of parts can be generated from the secret, and a minimum number of parts can be specified as needed in order to rebuild the secret. The secret is not <br>
	Stored within the program or database once it is encrypted, and must be mathematically uncovered by Lagrange interpolation in order to be revealed again.<br>
	<br>We hope this demonstration is informative, thanks for visiting!
